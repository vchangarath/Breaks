        <p class='hi'> Hi. We are a group of fun people from Seattle who believe that everyone needs to take a break from time to time. We created an online space for people to renew their minds by taking a short break to laugh and clear their mind. We hope to make people more productive by giving them a outlet to rest their minds for a short time during the day.</p>

Decision fatigue occurs when the prefrontal cortex in your brain is over used which leads to simple decision making, headaches and procrastination.</p>
